# Keycode Checker App

## Description

A small app that I have created in order to be able to find keycodes quickly; sometimes I am travelling and need to find keycodes and use them on international keyboards.

## Technologies Used

Technologies that were used is Bootstrap, to make this app responsive on various devices - I have used "mobile first" approach when building the app.

### Small side note

This is a very small app, not designed for showcasing - I am really only using it when I travel and need to use certain keycodes to access certain characters on intl. keyboards.
